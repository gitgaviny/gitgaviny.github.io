I am a passionate Ph.D. student in Speech and Audio Processing Lab at Kyoto University, working under the guidance of Prof. Tatsuya Kawahara. My academic journey includes a Master's degree from both Tianjin University and Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. My research primarily focuses on speech emotion recognition and automatic speech recognition, where I strive to combine technical expertise with real-world applications.
